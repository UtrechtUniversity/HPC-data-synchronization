# Glossary

* **archive**  
Long-term storage space for research data.

* **client**  
*"A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server." (Wikipedia)*

* **cloud storage platform**  
Surfdrive, Dropbox, Onedrive, Google Drive, etc. On these platforms, a user typically gets a certain amount of storage space. A client can be installed on a local working station to access and manage files and folders. Files and folders are typically synchronized automatically.

* **command line**  
*"A command line interface is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines)." (Wikipedia)*

* **config file**  
*"Configuration files are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs. They are used for user applications, server processes and operating system settings." (Wikipedia)*

* **file system**  
*"A file system controls how data is stored and retrieved." (Wikipedia)*

* **HPC**  
A High Performance Computing (HPC) platform is an aggregation of computing power that is capable of performing bigger tasks (in shorter time) compared to PCs.

* **icommands**  
icommands is client software to access data on Yoda (and other storage platforms with iRODS servers) from a command line.

* **job**  
With job we mean a computer program or script that assignes tasks to the compute nodes on an HPC platform.

* **local**  
Local refers to data stored- or processes performed on a PC (local working station, i.e. Desktop/laptop). Opposite to remote (see below).

* **path**  
An environment variable consisting of a list of one or more directories. Typically executable programs are located in these directories.

* **port**  
*"Virtual ports are an essential component of Internet Protocol (IP) networking. These ports allow software applications to share hardware resources without interfering with each other." (www.lifewire.com)*

* **rclone**  
Rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from local and remote storage locations.

* **remote**  
Remote refers to data stored- or processes performed on a remote server (HPC or storage platform).

* **server**  
*"In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client." (Wikipedia)*

* **staging**  
*"A staging area, or landing zone, is an intermediate storage area used for data processing ... the data staging area sits between the data source(s) and the data target(s)." (Wikipedia)*

* **Surfdrive**  
Cloud storage platform for research and education hosted by SURF.

* **tape**  
A typically cheap and secure system for storing data for the long-term.

* **threads**  
Computational tasks and data transfers can be single-threaded or multi-threaded, which means they are performed in serial (one at a time) or in parallel (multiple independent processes, files or file-parts at the same time).

* **unix**  
*"A family of computer operating systems ... The Unix concept entails that the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each performs a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows." (Wikipedia)*

* **WebDAV**  
*"WebDAV is a protocol that provides a framework for users to create, change and move documents on a server." (Wikipedia)*

* **Yoda**  
Storage platform for research and education hosted by [Utrecht University](https://yoda.sites.uu.nl/home/introduction-to-yoda-2/).
