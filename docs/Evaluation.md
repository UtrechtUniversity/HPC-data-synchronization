# Evaluation of storage and transfer tools

In our test procedure we have evaluated three types of storage tools (see below) that can be used as 'central storage facility' in a HPC workflow (see previous [section](./workflow.md)). All types have their own advantages and therefore cover a wide range of possible use cases, from researchers that just need a little more calculation power compared to their own working station, to researchers that work on very computationally expensive or data intensive tasks, to researchgroups that are generating terabytes of data on a frequent basis. Below we provide a short description of the storage tools and evaluation of thier performance in terms of data transfer and their ease of use.
