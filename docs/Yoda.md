icommands can be used to copy files to and from HPC systems and synchronize folders. Transfer can be done in parallel using multiple transfer ports.



## Job scripts
The above commands can be used in job scripts to transfer input data and scripts from the storage platform to the HPC cluster at the start of a job, and transfer the output back to the storage when the job has finished (and thereby clean up the HPC workspace).

Further documentation about jobscripts and example scripts can be found in [this section](./jobs.md).
