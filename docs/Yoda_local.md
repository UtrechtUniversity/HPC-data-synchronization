# Data transfer between Yoda and your local workingstation

Transferring data between Yoda and your local working station can be done in several ways. Three ways are described below that differ in terms of transfer speed and intuitiveness. The reported transfer speeds below are meant illustrative and are realisations on a laptop with cable connection at the university. Results can be treated as indications but could deviate largely in a different setup, e.g. depending on network adapter, internet connection or specific settings related to data transfer.

## Network drive
Simply browse to the file location on the network drive and copy-paste it to a local folder.


## Cyberduck
 For Windows:
1. Click Download Cyberduck-Installer-4.7.1.exe (or later version than 4.7.1, if displayed). 2. Locate the downloaded file and double click to begin installation. 3. Go through the install process. 




 It is also possible to synchronize a Yoda folder with a local folder using e.g. Cyberduck or WinSCP (find instructions for Cyberduck at the bottom of  [this website](https://yoda.sites.uu.nl/home/how-to-quick-guide/create-a-network-share/create-a-network-share-on-windows-using-cyberduck/)). 

Other options for transfer include: webdav connection using [Rclone](https://rclone.org/) or manual drag-and-drop transfer using [Winscp](https://winscp.net/) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/).
